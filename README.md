# **ItemManager** (1.8.8 support only)
Manage items from a config. **ItemManager** will automatically update items when you want to change item `lore`, `glow`, `leather rgb` and `unbreakability`.

# Description
The plugin kind of relies on `MagicSpells` or `MythicMobs` (I dont remember which one), this plugin really isn't something that should be used on a production server unless you actually need something like this. **ItemManager**'s main purpose is to update items without removing old items from a players inventory. This allows players to have updated versions of items that have for example: `New abilities`, `different lore`, `glow`, `rgb` etc. This plugin has many issues I wish to solve, which is why I recommend not using this. I am uploading this to github just for show, and if you actually want to use this, then go ahead, I will not be giving support for this plugin as it's a plugin for a friend of mine.

## Features:
* Ability to update item meta if changed in the config.
* Easily create items from the config and load them in game using `/imreload`.
* Tabcomplete support - (`/giveitem`)
* Apply knockback resistance to items.
